# 📐 Shape Area Calculator - DCIT 318 Assignment 2 (Task 2)

This is a C# console application that demonstrates the use of **abstract classes** and **abstract methods** in object-oriented programming. It allows users to calculate the area of different shapes (Circle and Rectangle) by using polymorphism through an abstract base class.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🧱 Abstract base class `Shape` with an abstract method `GetArea()`.
- 🔵 `Circle` class implements area calculation using the formula π × r².
- 🟪 `Rectangle` class implements area calculation using the formula width × height.
- 📋 User menu to select shape and input dimensions.
- 🔁 Runs in a loop for multiple calculations until user exits.
- ❌ Handles invalid or non-numeric input gracefully.
- 🎨 Uses color to enhance user interaction.
