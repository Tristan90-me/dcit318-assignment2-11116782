# 🐾 Inheritance & Method Overriding - DCIT 318 Assignment 2 (Task 1)

This C# console application demonstrates **inheritance** and **method overriding**—two key concepts in object-oriented programming. It simulates animal sounds using a base class and two derived classes.

---

## ✅ Features

- 👨‍👩‍👧 Base class `Animal` defines a virtual method `MakeSound()`.
- 🐶 Derived class `Dog` overrides `MakeSound()` to output `"Bark"`.
- 🐱 Derived class `Cat` overrides `MakeSound()` to output `"Meow"`.
- 🧠 Demonstrates **polymorphism**: different outputs for the same method depending on object type.
- 📋 Interactive menu lets the user choose which animal to simulate.
- 🔁 Allows repeated usage with a loop and exit option.
- 🎨 Colored output enhances user interaction.
